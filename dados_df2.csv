7,12,"Solution of structural reliability problems by the First Order method require optimization algorithms to find the smallest distance between a limit state function and the origin of standard Gaussian space. The Hassofer-Lind-Rackwitz-Fiessler (HLRF) algorithm, developed specifically for this purpose, has been shown to be efficient but not robust, as it fails to converge for a significant number of problems. On the other hand, recent developments in general (augmented Lagrangian) optimization techniques have not been tested in aplication to structural reliability problems. In the present article, three new optimization algorithms for structural reliability analysis are presented. One algorithm is based on the HLRF, but uses a new differentiable merit function with Wolfe conditions to select step length in linear search. It is shown in the article that, under certain assumptions, the proposed algorithm generates a sequence that converges to the local minimizer of the problem. Two new augmented Lagrangian methods are also presented, which use quadratic penalties to solve nonlinear problems with equality constraints. Performance and robustness of the new algorithms is compared to the classic augmented Lagrangian method, to HLRF and to the improved HLRF (iHLRF) algorithms, in the solution of 25 benchmark problems from the literature.

94,165,"The wave equation with frictional damping working over the whole domain was studied by several authors. For example we have the work of E. Zuazua [17] who showed the uniform rate of decay of the solution for a large class of nonlinear wave equations. The natural question in this direction is about the uniform rate of decay when the dissipation is effective only in a part of the domain. In Nakao [9] and Zuazua [15] it was proved that when the dissipation works in a neighborhood of the boundary, the solutions decay exponentially or at a certain algebraic rate to zero as time goes to infinity. This means that the dissipation working in a strategic part of the material is strong enough to produce uniform rate of decay of thesolutions. Such results are connected with Control Theory. It was proved by Lions [8] the exact controllability for the wave equation. This means that there exists a control , with support con-tained in a subset of the boundary, driving the system to the rest. Any time when we can control the solution acting on a part of thematerial, it is possible to introduce a dissipative mechanism at the same place, to produce uniform decay of the solutions. We may summarize this by saying that controllability implies stabilization. That is, if we can control the system, then we can also stabilize the system introducing a suitable dissipative mechanism working in the same part.Unfortunately the controllability is shown basically for linear problems, and only for a few classes of semilinear problems.

We consider three inversion algorithms: the Gauss-Newton method of linearized inversion (LI), the genetic algorithm (GA), and a hybrid approach (GA-LI) that uses LI to improve the best model at the end of each step of the GA. The medium parametrization consists of the partition of the domain into fixed homogeneous rectangular blocks such that their resistivities are the only free parameters. The apparent resistivity is evaluated by an iterative scheme that is derived from a finite-difference discretization of the potential differential equation. We enhance the convergence rate of the scheme by adopting an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner. Numerical results using synthetic and real 2D apparent resistivity data formed by sets of VES for the Schlumberger configuration illustrate the performance of the hybrid GA-LI algorithm.

The TDR − TDX filter produces sharp peaks over the centers of the sources, while the TDR + TDX filter generates plateaus over them.

The proposed methodology consists of developing algorithms with a hybrid approach combining the augmented Lagrangian method, which penalizes the more complicated constraints of the problem, with Newton’s method, to solve the subproblems generated at each step of the algorithm. In a second moment, we extend the algorithms to a broader class of problems including more than one constraint, which can be nonlinear. In this case, we use an approach similar to the Gauss-Newton method for the least squares problem, to enable the use of only first-order information concerning the constraints of the problem.

The generality of this algorithm lies in the fact that the analysis of its convergence is almost always guaranteed once the probability distribution used in the calculation of the iterates satisfies some hypotheses. The control of infeasibility is done through the strategy of the filter methods. Based on this general algorithm, we developed the FDDS algorithm, which combines the filter method with the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm. In the FDDS the iterates are calculated by adding random perturbations with normal distribution in the dynamically chosen coordinates of the best current point. However, with the strategy of generating multiple trial points in each iteration, the cost with objective function evaluations can be quite high. In order to reduce the number of function evaluations, we propose the FDDSRBF algorithm, which has the same general algorithm structure and whose multiple trial points are generated in the same way as in the FDDS. The FDDSRBF uses a cubic model of radial basis functions, to approximate the objective function, in the selection of the best trial point. The proposed algorithms do not compute or approximate any derivatives of the objective and constraint functions. Theoretical results concerning the sufficient conditions for the almost surely convergence of the proposed algorithms were presented. Promising computational results, in comparison to performance of the proposed algorithms with other algorithms in the literature when solving 42 problems of three different sets, were obtained. The FDDSRBF Algorithm provided competitive results when compared to the other methods.

207,11," Among the problems that have brought curiosity of laymen and scientists for centuries is the propagation of water waves. Mathematically speaking, the movement of water waves is modelled by the hydrodynamic equation derived by Euler in the middle of the 18th century. The Euler equations consist of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations with free boundary conditions. Several authors have studied this problem in the context of travelling water wave with constant vorticity, however there are only a few works devoted to the study of the numerical stability of such waves. The assumption of travelling wave allows to eliminate the time dependence in the governing equations turning the flow into a steady one, which makes the numerical treatment somewhat simpler. In this work we study numerically the stability of solitary waves for the steady Euler equation in a shear flow with constant vorticity. Through a conformal mapping we rewrite the (steady and time-dependent) Euler equations in a new coordinate system in which numerical computations are performed via a pseudo-spectral method. This approach permit us to consider the solutions of the steady problem as initial data for the time-dependent Euler equations. Consequently, we investigate in what extent solutions of the steady problem are indeed travelling wave solutions for the the time-dependent problem. Although we are able to compute solitary waves for the steady Euler equations for large values of vorticity, our results indicate that these waves are not numerically stable. Furthermore, we notice that only solitary waves in flows with small values of vorticity turn out to be numerically stable.

212,16," In this work we proposed two algorithms of unconstrained optimization. The first one is a trust-region method, where the trust radius is given by d_(k)||grad f (x_(k))|| and d_(k) is a sequence updated in each step. The behaviour of d_(k) is inspired in the reciprocal of d_(k) from the WNGrad method [48], but with the difference that d_(k) may not be monotonically decreasing like the reciprocal of d_(k). In the numerical tests we can see that the proposed method is competitive with other methods, including the standard trust-region method. The second presented algorithm is a gradient descent method in the Riemannian context, with step -t_(k)grad f (x_(k)), where t_(k) have an update similar to d_(k). In the numerical experiments, the results indicate to a better performance compared with the Armijo’s linesearch. In both methods we can split in two cases, a conservative version taking at most O(e^-2) iterations to find an e-stationary point and a flexible version taking at most O(|log(e)|e^-2) iterations to find e-stationary point, with e > 0.

224,28," The aim of this dissertation is to propose a definition for the Maslov Index, where we consider the context of a split vector space, that is, a vector space provided with a symmetrical bilinear form that is split , rather than a symplectic vector space. Therefore, we first present some fundamental results about split vector spaces, in order to generalize the concept and properties of maximal isotropic subspaces. Once this definition is presented, we introduce the set of all maximal isotropic subspaces, called Lagrangian Grassmannian, and as done in the symplectic case, we will show that this set has a structure of homogenous manifold, among other properties.

225,29," In this thesis, we study a class of optimization problems, called Mathematical Programs with Cardinality Constraints (MPCaC). This kind of problem is generally difficult to deal with, because it involves a constraint that is not continuous neither convex, but provides sparse solutions. Thereby we reformulate MPCaC in a suitable way, by modeling it as mixed-integer problem and then addressing its continuous counterpart, which will be referred to as relaxed problem. We investigate the relaxed problem by analyzing the general constraints in two cases: linear and nonlinear. In the linear case, we propose a general approach and present a discussion of the Guignard and Abadie constraint qualifications, proving in this case that every minimizer of the relaxed problem satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. On the other hand, in the nonlinear case, we show that some standard constraint qualifications may be violated. Motivated to find a minimizer for the MPCaC problem, we define new stationarity conditions, weaker than KKT, by proposing a unified approach that goes from the weakest to the strongest stationarity (within a certain range of conditions). However, these conditions are not optimality conditions. Thereby, we also propose an Approximate Weak stationarity (AW-stationarity) concept designed to deal with MPCaC problems. We proved that it is a legitimate optimality condition independently of any constraint qualification. Many research on sequential optimality conditions has been addressed for nonlinear constrained optimization in the last few years, some works in the context of Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). However, as far as we know, no sequential optimality condition has been proposed for MPCaC problems. We also establish some relationships between our AW-stationarity and other usual sequential optimality conditions, such as AKKT, CAKKT and PAKKT. We point out that, despite the computational appeal of the sequential optimality conditions, our aim until this moment was to discuss the theoretical aspects of such conditions for MPCaC problems. The algorithmic aspects behind our theory are subject of ongoing research.

227,31," In this thesis we deal with long-term operation planning problems of hydrothermal power systems by considering scenario analysis and risk aversion. The operation planning problem consists in defining an operational policy, determining the generation of both hydroelectric and thermal plants in order to satisfy the system demand in a given period with the lowest expected operation cost. The definition of an operation policy depends on the scenario of inflows over the period considered. Once chosen a scenario from a set of scenarios generated from 85 years of historical data of m onth inflows, we have a large-scale deterministic problem that includes nonlinear constraints due to the head computation in hydroelectric plants. However, we wish to obtain non-anticipative solutions, i.e., solutions in which the decision of the first month does not depend on the L scenarios considered. This problem is L times larger than the determ inistic one, and can be solved by methods that decompose the problem into L subproblems, such as the Progressive Hedging method. An advantage of the decomposition methods is allowing the parallelization of their implementation. In addition, we apply the risk measure conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in the operation cost minimizing problem considering three approaches. The first one applies the CVaR risk measure to the total operation cost. The second approach uses CVaR only on the deficit cost, which is an event to be avoided. And the third one considers a convex combination of the expected value and CVaR risk measure, both of the total cost. Another contribution of this thesis is the proposal of strategies to reduce the number of scenarios in such way that the decision obtained by solving the risk-averse problem considering the subset of effective scenarios is as reliable as the decision from the whole set of scenarios. N umerical experiments are presented for validation of the techniques proposed by solving the problem for two test systems extracted from the Brazilian interconnected system with real data provided by the Operador Nacional do Sistema - ONS.

This motivates the presentation of our method, which stands somewhat in between those alternatives. Two flavors of our algorithm are described, which depend on the Dirichlet conditions imposed on the monolithic predictor: one uses constant conditions and the other uses time-dependent ones.

237,41," In this work we investigate optim al control problems in continuous time. A novel theory is developed for finite horizon problems w ith two objectives of different nature th a t need to be minimized simultaneously. One objective is in the classical Bolza form and the other one is defined as a maximum function. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman framework we characterize the weak Pareto front and the Pareto front for such problems. First we define an auxiliary optim al control problem w ithout state constraints and show th a t the weak Pareto front is a subset of the zero level set of the corresponding value function. Then w ith a geometrical approach we establish a characterization of the Pareto front. Some numerical examples are considered to show the interest of our proposal. The encouraging results obtained with the finite horizon m otivated us to investigate infinite horizon multi-objective optim al control problems and characterize the corresponding Pareto front. Additionally, we introduce a m ethod, based on the dynamical programming principle, to reconstruct optim al trajectories for infinite horizon control problems w ith state constraints. The theory is applied to energy management systems. We compare the ability of different batteries as a substitute of the load shaving mechanism in smoothing the load peaks, for simple, yet representative, power mix systems w ith two different objectives. The multi-objective approach makes it possible to obtain a compromise between the minimization of generation costs and the carbon emissions of the therm al power plants in the mix.

239,43," Probability constraints play a key role in optimization problems involving uncertainties. These constraints (also known as chance constraints) require that an inequality system depending on a random vector has to be satisfied with high enough probability. In this work we deal with chance-constrained optimization problems having mixed-integer variables. We assume that the involved functions are convex and the probability constraint has generalized convexity properties. In order to deal with optimization problems of this type, we combine outer-approximation (OA) and bundle method algorithms. OA algorithms have been applied to smooth problems and to a small class of nonsmooth problems. In this work we extend the OA to handle more general nonsmooth problems. Moreover, we show that when the resulting OA's nonlinear subproblems are solved by a bundle method, then subgradients satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are readily available regardless the structure of the nonsmooth convex functions. This property is crucial for proving (finite) convergence of the OA algorithm. Chance-constrained problems appear, for instance, in (stochastic) energy models. In the context of interest, at least one nonlinear constraint models the probability function P[h(x, y) ? ?], where h is a concave map and ? ? Rm is a random vector. In general, multidimensional numerical integration is employed to evaluate this probability function. As an alternative to deal with probability constraints (which is very expensive computationally), we propose approximating the probability measure P with a suitable copula. We investigate a family of nonsmooth copulae and provide some new and useful generalized convexity properties. In particular, we prove that Zhang's copulae are ?-concave for all ? ? 0. This result allows us to approximate chance-constrained programs by much simpler copula-constrained ones. We assess numerically the given approaches on two classes of problems coming from power system management.

From this the Lax-Milgram theorem is used to obtain the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the abstract variational problem associated to this equation.

Two different boundary conditions are considered, namely the Dirichlet condition and the Engquist-Majda condition. In both cases, the discretization in space is performed using the spectral element method based on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature formula, while the discretization in time is performed using an explicit method from the Newmark family of finite difference schemes. A rigorous hp analysis of the discretization error is presented, providing upper bounds for the error in terms of the element mesh size, the degree the polynomial basis functions, and the time step. These bounds generalize several known results in the literature in the context of the wave equation with constant coefficients.

In order to apply the technique to classification problems, we seek to base its use mathematically, since it involves a quadratic, convex and constrained programming problem. For the analysis of the technique, we use the theory of Lagrangian duality, which we noticed to facilitate the calculations and the analysis of the solutions. In addition, we rewrite results using a saddle point, without needing this concept.

Some comparisons have been made to analyze the different parameters of the Gaussian kernel function used to solve the problem when it is not possible to find a decision function in the input space. We have verified that the efficiency of the technique depends on the choice of the regularization parameter, the kernel function and its parameters.

In the experiments performed, with a C-SVM it was possible to reach an accuracy of 72,7% for predictions 6 months ahead.

Then, this hybrid model was incorporated to a trading strategy for negotiation of index fund BOVA11, which tries to replicate the movements of Ibovespa. Numerical simulations suggest that this trading strategy based on forecasts is able to provide gains significantly higher than those obtained with a simple strategy known as buy and hold.

To do that, one can associate each problem to a semigroup wich can be used discern the solutions behavior.

The first problem has a globally distributed damping and in the second case the dissipation is partial and considered in a transmission problem.

276,80," This work covers two diferent subjects. First we present an algorithm for solving constrained optimization problems that does not make explicit use of the objective function derivatives. The algorithm mixes an inexact restoration framework with filter techniques. Each iteration is decomposed in two phases: a feasibility phase that reduces an infeasibility measure; and an optimality phase that reduces the objective function value. The optimality step is computed by derivative-free trust-region internal iterations, where the models can be constructed by any technique, provided that they are reasonable approximations of the objective function around the current point. Assuming that this and classical hypotheses hold, we prove that the algorithm satisfes an eficiency condition, which provides its global convergence. Preliminar numerical results are presented. In the second subject, we discuss the linear complementarity problem. Some block principal pivoting algorithms, eficient for solving this kind of problem, are discussed. An analysis of some techniques to guarantee convergence results of these algorithms is made. We present some numerical results to compare the eficiency and the robustness of the algorithms. Moreover we discuss two applications of the block principal pivoting: nonnegative matrix factorization and preconditioned projected gradient methods.

279,83," This thesis presents three works on nonlinear and nonconvex optimization. In the _rst work, a subspace version of the Powell-Yuan trust-region algorithm is proposed for equalityconstrained optimization problems. The main feature of the method presented is that, at each iteration, the Celis-Dennis-Tapia (CDT) subproblem is solved in a certain subspace, which reduces the computational e_ort necessary to compute the step. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the subspace version of the method is faster than its original version on problems where the number of constraints is much lower than the number of variables. In the second work, it is investigated the convergence and the worst-case complexity of the nonlinear stepsize control algorithm recently proposed by Toint (Optim. Methods Softw. 28: 82-95, 2013) for smooth unconstrained optimization problems. The global convergence of the method is proved under the assumption that the Hessians of the models can grow by a constant amount at each iteration. Moreover, worst-case complexity bounds are estimated. The results obtained are extended to some algorithms for composite nonsmooth optimization problems and unconstrained multiobjective problems as well. Finally, in the third work, a derivative-free trust-region algorithm is proposed for composite nonsmooth optimization problems. The global convergence of the method is established and a worst-case complexity bound is obtained. The complexity analysis is then especialized to the case where the composite function is an exact penalty function, providing a worst-case complexity bound for equality-constrained optimization problems when the solution is computed using a derivative-free exact penalty algorithm. Preliminary numerical results with _nite minimax problems and with equality-constrained problems suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising.

284,88," In this work we describe methods to find an (approximate) solution for the saddle-point (SP) and Nash equilibrium problems. The algorithms are special instances of a hybrid extragradient proximal method introduced by Svaiter and Solodov [Solodov; Svaiter, 2000] where the inclusion sub-problems are solved using an accelerated gradient method. The proposed methods generalize the accelerated algorithm of [He; Monteiro, 2014] in the following ways: a) in a generalization, the considered problems are general SP problems instead of SP problems with a bilinear structure; b) in other generalization, the algorithm is based on Bregman distances rather than the Euclidian one; c) in other generalization, the considered problem is the Nash equilibrium problem instead of the saddle-point. As in He and Monteiro's method, the proposed methods have the advantage that any scalar choice for the stepsize can be used. Also, for the saddle-point problems, a certain choice for the stepsize can yield an optimal complexity for the method.

285,89," In this thesis, we consider two kinds of convection-diffusion problems, namely the classical time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the space-fractional convection-diffusion equations in two dimensions. For Navier-Stokes equations, we use the method of characteristics to make nonlinear equations linear, and we introduce an auxiliary variable to reduce high-order equation to one order system. Carefully choosing numerical fluxes and adding penalty terms, a stable and symmetric characteristic local discontinuous Galerkin (CLDG) method is proposed. With this symmetry, it is easy to perform numerical stability and error estimates. Numerical experiments are performed to verify theoretical results. For the space-fractional convection-diffusion problems, we still use the method of characteristics to tackle the time derivative and convective terms together. For the fractional term, we introduce some auxiliary variables to split the Riemann-Liouville derivative into Riemann-Liouville integral and integer order derivative. Thus a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method (HDG) is proposed. Finally we use general analytic methods to perform the stability analysis and convergence estimates of the HDG scheme. As far as we know, this is the first time the discontinuous Galerkin method and the method of characteristics are combined to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations and space-fractional convection-diffusion equations in 2D. These schemes can be applied and further studied into other problems as well. The numerical results are consistent with theoretical results.

In the following chapters, the barrier diffusion and the tunnelling through two identical barriers are studied with the approach of multiple peaks, which coherence and need comes from the agreement of general results (above potential step), resonance effects (in the double tunnelling) and time forecasts given by the stationary phase method (that clarifies the so-called Generalized Hartman Effect. This analytical approach perfectly consents with the displayed numerical simulations. The analogy between the Schrödinger equation with potential barrier and the monochromatic transverse electric in a stratified medium is explored in the last chapter regarding multiple localized reflected and transmitted beams through dielectric barriers.",2009,Vinicius Jose Henrique da Costa Leonardi,Dissertações,O formalismo de pacotes de onda aplicado a fenomenos de múltipla difusão e tunelamento,Tese/Dis,this work intends to present the phenomenology of interaction between wave packets and potential barrier  the tunnelling is numerically analyzed to extract qualitative info about the delay times and the appearance of peaks  what requires a careful treatment for the hartman effect  in the following chapters  the barrier diffusion and the tunnelling through two identical barriers are studied with the approach of multiple peaks  which coherence and need comes from the agreement of general results  above potential step   resonance effects  in the double tunnelling  and time forecasts given by the stationary phase method  that clarifies the so called generalized hartman effect  this analytical approach perfectly consents with the displayed numerical simulations  the analogy between the schrödinger equation with potential barrier and the monochromatic transverse electric in a stratified medium is explored in the last chapter regarding multiple localized reflected and transmitted beams through dielectric barriers ,"['intends', 'present', 'phenomenology', 'interaction', 'packet', 'potential', 'barrier', 'tunnelling', 'numerically', 'analyzed', 'extract', 'qualitative', 'delay', 'appearance', 'requires', 'careful', 'treatment', 'hartman', 'effect', 'following', 'chapter', 'barrier', 'diffusion', 'tunnelling', 'identical', 'barrier', 'studied', 'approach', 'multiple', 'coherence', 'agreement', 'general', 'result', 'potential', 'resonance', 'effect', 'double', 'tunnelling', 'forecast', 'given', 'stationary', 'phase', 'method', 'clarifies', 'called', 'generalized', 'hartman', 'effect', 'analytical', 'approach', 'perfectly', 'consent', 'displayed', 'numerical', 'simulation', 'analogy', 'schrödinger', 'equation', 'potential', 'barrier', 'monochromatic', 'transverse', 'electric', 'stratified', 'medium', 'explored', 'chapter', 'regarding', 'multiple', 'localized', 'reflected', 'transmitted', 'dielectric', 'barrier']"

320,124,One of the goals of this work is to suggest a definition for g-closed sets in Ltopological spaces and study some of its properties. We could obtain in L-topology similar results to those obtained in topological spaces. We also propose an L-fuzzy version for Alexandroff spaces which we call here L-Alexandroff spaces. On these spaces we define g*-closed sets and obtain similar results to those obtained in Alexandroff spaces,2006,Rodrigo de Lima,Dissertações,Conjuntos g-fechados em espaços L-topológicos e conjuntos g*-fechados em espaços L-Alexandroff,Tese/Dis,one of the goals of this work is to suggest a definition for g closed sets in ltopological spaces and study some of its properties  we could obtain in l topology similar results to those obtained in topological spaces  we also propose an l fuzzy version for alexandroff spaces which we call here l alexandroff spaces  on these spaces we define g  closed sets and obtain similar results to those obtained in alexandroff spaces,"['suggest', 'definition', 'closed', 'ltopological', 'space', 'study', 'property', 'could', 'obtain', 'topology', 'similar', 'result', 'obtained', 'topological', 'space', 'propose', 'fuzzy', 'version', 'alexandroff', 'space', 'alexandroff', 'space', 'space', 'define', 'closed', 'obtain', 'similar', 'result', 'obtained', 'alexandroff', 'space']"
